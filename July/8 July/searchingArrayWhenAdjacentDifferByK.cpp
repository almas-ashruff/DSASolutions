// A step array is an array of integers where each element has a difference of at most k with its neighbor. 
// Given a key x, we need to find the index value of x if multiple-element exist to 
// return the first occurrence of the key.

// The idea is to start comparing from the leftmost element and find the difference between 
// the current array element and x. Let this difference be ‘diff’. From the given property of the array, 
// we always know that x must be at least ‘diff/k’ away, so instead of searching one by one, 
// we jump ‘diff/k’.

        // array element and x divided by k
